# Retrospective Encoding For Conventional Ultrasound Sequences (REFoCUS)

Current methods:

*  Adjoint (leave param empty for no ramp filter, use param to define one if desired)
*  Truncated SVD (condition number)
*  Regularized SVD (regularizing number)
*  Tikhonov regularization (regularizing number)
